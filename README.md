Boolean reduction using python: a method to translate k-body interaction to 2-body to be implemented on a quantum annealer (D-Wave). 
Manipulation of a long symbolic expression, normaly found in protein folding, migh be too tedious to do by hand. In this project we are developing a software to do the conversion based on symbolic python (sympy).
